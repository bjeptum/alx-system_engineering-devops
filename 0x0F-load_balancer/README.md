## 0x0F. Load balancer

In this project, I was assigned two more personal servers. The aim was to improve my web stack so that there is redundancy for my web servers. This was so as to be able to accept more traffic by doubling the number of web servers, and to make my infrastructure more reliable. If one web server fails, I would still have a second one to handle requests.

For this project, I had to write Bash scripts to automate my work. All scripts,designed to configure a brand new Ubuntu server to match the task requirements.
