## 0x0D-web_stack_debugging_0


The Webstack debugging series helped me to understand the art of debugging.

Being able to debug a webstack is essential for a Full-Stack Software Engineer, and it takes practice to be a master of it.

In this debugging series, broken/bugged webstacks were given and the final goal is to come up with a Bash script that once executed, will bring the webstack to a working state. But before writing this Bash script, I had to figure out what is going on and fix it manually.
