## 0x09. Web infrastructure design

This project entailed designing different types of server web infrastructure.

With each infrastructure, the issues with each were explained touching on:

- SPOF (Single Point of Failure)
- Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)
- Scaling if too much incoming traffic
- Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS)
- Monitoring
